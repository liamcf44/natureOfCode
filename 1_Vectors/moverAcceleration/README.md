# Vectors

## Mover

### Description

The program is a slightly more complex mover. It draws a continuous chain of squares, coloured by a mapped Perlin Noise value, creating a chain of multicoloured squares across the canvas. The acceleration of the mover is controller by the same Perlin Noise value that colours the object.
