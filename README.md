# Nature of Code

## Description

This repo is my working through of the excellent book Nature of Code by the amazing Daniel Shiffman, more info can be found at https://natureofcode.com/.

Each directory will represent a chapter of the book, numbered from 0 upwards, and will hold my version of some examples in that chapter.

Each example will be a [P5js](https://p5js.org/) adaption of the [Processing](https://processing.org/) code in the book, with my own twist on it (definitely not guarenteed to work).
